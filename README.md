# Unix            <br />
In the a Unix.java program, it simulates the basic functioning of the Unix operating system. <br />
We will assume that our version of the Unix operating system only has the following commands: <br />
• cd - changes to the root directory<br />
• cd {directory name} – changes to the specified directory <br />
• createfile {file name} – creates a file with the specified name <br />
• mkdir {directory name} – creates a directory with the specified name <br />
• rm {directory/file name} – removes the directory or file with the specified name <br />
• ls – lists the contents of the current directory <br />
• pwd – returns the name of the current directory <br />
• quota – returns the disk usage of the current directory (including subdirectories). A directory requires 3 bytes and a file requires 7 bytes <br />
We assumed that our operating system runs on a computer that has infinite memory. <br />
However, a directory can only contain two entities, two files, two directories or a file and a directory. <br />
